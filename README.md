# RunPod CRO Engineering Take-Home Assessment

Welcome! This assessment is designed to evaluate your approach to conversion rate optimization and your technical ability to implement changes. We're excited to see your creative solutions.

## Overview

You'll be optimizing one of our ad campaign landing pages (runpod.io/ppc/gpu-cloud) to increase sign-up conversion rates. You have complete creative freedom to modify or rebuild the page as you see fit.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:
\```bash
yarn install
\```

Run the development server:
\```bash
yarn dev
\```

## Objectives

### 1. Page Optimization (45-60 minutes)
- Modify the existing page to optimize for higher sign-up rate (where user clicks on sign up CTAs)
- Focus areas can include:
 - Call-to-action buttons
 - Value proposition messaging
 - Page structure and content hierarchy
 - User journey optimization
- Feel free to:
 - Modify any existing sections
 - Add new sections you believe would drive conversions
 - Remove or restructure content
 - Completely rebuild the page if you believe it would be more effective

### 2. A/B Testing Strategy Document (20-30 minutes)
Create a document outlining:
- Key hypotheses you'd like to test
- Proposed A/B test scenarios  
- Success metrics
- Testing methodology
- Prioritization framework for your proposed tests

### 3. Bonus: Performance Optimization
- While not the primary focus, improvements to the page's Lighthouse performance score will be considered a plus

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll be focusing on:
- Strategic thinking around conversion optimization
- Understanding of user psychology and conversion principles
- Structured approach to A/B testing
- Technical implementation quality

We're NOT heavily weighing:
- Visual design sophistication
- Perfect copy (we know you don't have deep knowledge of our ICP yet)
- Pixel-perfect implementations

## Submission Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new private repository under your GitHub account
3. Implement your changes 
4. Share access to your repository with luke.piette@runpod.io [username: lukepiette]
5. Make sure to include in your README:
  - Brief overview of your major changes
  - Rationale behind key decisions
  - Any assumptions you made
  - Approximate time spent on each section

Note: Please ensure your repository is private and only shared with our team members.

## Time Expectation

We respect your time and expect this to take about 1.5 hours total. Don't feel pressured to spend more time perfecting every detail - we're more interested in your approach and thinking process.

## Questions?
